# CRUD
A CRUD application is a software program or system that performs the basic operations of Create, Read, Update, and Delete on data
1. Create (C):
  - Design a user-friendly form for data input.
  - Implement a PHP script for input validation.
  - Execute a MySQL query to insert validated data into the database.

2.Read (R):
  - Develop a PHP script to fetch data from MySQL.
  - Dynamically display retrieved data on the web page for user viewing.

3.Update (U):
  - Generate a form with pre-filled data based on the selected record.
  - Use a PHP script for validation of modified data.
  - Execute a MySQL query to update the corresponding record in the database.

4. Delete (D):
  - Create a confirmation mechanism for user deletion requests.
  - Implement a PHP script to handle delete requests.
  - Execute a MySQL query to remove the confirmed record from the database.

This systematic approach ensures effective CRUD functionality in a web-based application, enabling users to interact with and manage data seamlessly.
